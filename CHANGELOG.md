### 🌟 [2.4.0] - BaseScreen Primary Scroll Controller

- 🆕 **New Features**:
  - Added `primaryScrollController` getter to `BaseScreen` — lazily creates and owns a `ScrollController`, wrapped as `PrimaryScrollController` above the `Scaffold` so iOS status-bar tap scrolls to top automatically on every screen
  - Added `attachPrimaryScrollController` flag (defaults `true`) — set to `false` on embedded `BaseScreen` widgets so their scroll views attach to the outer screen's controller instead of shadowing it

- 📦 **Dependency Updates**:
  - Migrated `InternetConnectionHandler` to `InternetConnection.createInstance(triggerStream: Connectivity().onConnectivityChanged)` to preserve hardware-change detection

### 🎯 [2.3.2] - Connection & Error Navigation Hardening

- 🐛 **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed `_hasNetworkAdapter()` ignoring ethernet and VPN — desktop/VPN users were falsely reported as offline
  - Fixed `_deduplicatedCheck` completer never resetting on error — could permanently block all future connectivity checks
  - Fixed stale `true` cache served after connectivity drops — cache is now invalidated immediately when the stream reports disconnect
  - Fixed multiple `NoInternetScreen` stacking when concurrent API calls fail — guarded by `isNoInternetSceneShown` check before navigation
  - Fixed duplicate "Network issues" bottom sheets / toasts in consumer apps — subsequent no-internet failures return `NullNonRenderState` instead of emitting `ErrorStateNonRender` while `NoInternetScreen` is already shown
  - Fixed `NoInternetScreen` refresh button showing no feedback when still offline — now shows an error toast
  - Fixed `isNoInternetSceneShown` flag never resetting if screen is removed without refresh (e.g. app restart) — added `dispose()` to reset the flag

- 🔄 **Refactored**:
  - Unified `InternetConnectionHandler` to use a single shared `InternetConnection` instance
  - Added 5s TTL cache, request deduplication, and adaptive ping timeout (10s cold start, 5s afterwards)
  - `isGoogleInternetConnected()` now falls back to network-adapter check when ping fails — fixes false "no internet" on active Wi-Fi/mobile
  - Replaced shared global `ToolsHelper.stopRepeating` debounce in `BaseBloc._navigate()` with per-screen-type debounce — different error screens (no-internet, maintenance) no longer block each other

### 🛠 [2.3.1] - Reactive Module Extraction & BlocPartBuilder Enhancement

- 🔀 **Breaking Changes**:
  - Removed Reactive state management module (`ReactiveNotifier`, `AsyncReactiveNotifier`, `Reactive`, `ReactiveBuilder`, `ReactiveProvider`, `ReactiveSelector`) — now available as a standalone package: [optireact](https://pub.dev/packages/optireact)

- 🆕 **New Features**:
  - Added multi-state support to `BlocPartBuilder` — pass a `states` list to handle multiple state types in a single widget using Dart 3 pattern matching

- 🐛 **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed `ShowIfHasValue` assertion crash when both `value` and `values` are null — widget now gracefully handles null inputs instead of throwing

### 🎯 [2.3.0] - Stability & Network Enhancements

- 🆕 **New Features**:
  - Added `ReactiveSelector<T, S>` widget for type-safe property selection (replaces `Reactive.select` with proper generics)
  - Added `ReactiveBuilder<T>` widget for lightweight `ValueListenable` rebuilds with `buildWhen` support
  - Added `BlocPartBuilder` for building specific parts of BLoC state
  - Added `CancelToken` support in `NetworkHelper.request()` for request cancellation
  - Added `addInterceptor()` / `removeInterceptor()` to `NetworkHelper` for custom Dio interceptors
  - Added per-request `connectTimeout` and `receiveTimeout` in `NetworkHelper.request()`
  - Added `timeout` parameter to `SafeCall.execute()`
  - Added `NoInternetException` type for type-safe no-internet detection
  - Added SSL certificate pinning support via `NetworkHelper.loadPinningCertificate()`
  - Added `builder` parameter to `AppConfig` for custom root-level widget wrappers
  - Added `ToastConfig` for global toast color customization
  - Added full WASM/web platform support via conditional imports and platform stubs

- 🐛 **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed `NetworkHelper` creating new Dio instance per repository (now singleton)
  - Fixed memory leak in `TextInputHelper` — listener removal callback now returned
  - Fixed magic string `"487"` for no-internet detection — replaced with `NoInternetException` type check
  - Fixed force-unwrap crash in `MaintenanceScreen.refreshCallBack`
  - Fixed `ConnectionHelper` subscription never cancelled and stale cache
  - Fixed `BaseScreen.showLoading()` using 300s unCancellable timeout (now 30s cancellable Timer)
  - Fixed `BaseScreen.closeKeyboard()` and `CoreSetup` force-unwrap on `primaryFocus`
  - Fixed `BaseScreen._handleNullBuilder()` returning `dynamic` instead of `Widget`
  - Fixed `NoInternetScreen` setting static flag inside `build()` (moved to `initState()`)
  - Fixed `LazyIndexedStack` force-unwraps on nullable controllers and `pageBuilder`
  - Fixed `ApiResponse` only extracting `data["message"]` — now tries `error`, `detail`, `error_message`
  - Fixed `ApiResponse` treating 403 as generic error — now handled as `unauthorizedError` like 401
  - Fixed unsafe `_previousValue as T` cast in `Reactive` widget
  - Fixed `AsyncReactiveNotifier.execute()` race condition with concurrent calls (operation ID guard)
  - Fixed `ContentBuilder` not caching BLoC when `disposeBloc: false`
  - Fixed `StateBuilder` `buildWhen` not working (rewritten with `BlocBuilder`)
  - Fixed `EventTransformers` debounce missing `isClosed` guard
  - Fixed `DioConnectivityRequest` missing retry guard and completion checks
  - Fixed `ExpandableText` hardcoded LTR direction
  - Fixed `HideOnScroll` accessing `scrollController.position` without `hasClients` guard

### 🛠 [2.2.1] - CoreSetup Builder & Toast Customization

- 🆕 **New Features**:
  - Added `builder` parameter (`TransitionBuilder?`) to `AppConfig` for injecting custom root-level widget wrappers (e.g., providers, overlays) on top of the internal BotToast and MediaQuery setup in `CoreSetup`
  - Added `ToastConfig` for global toast color customization — override `successColor`, `errorColor`, `infoColor`, `warningColor`, `iconColor`, and `textColor` at runtime via `ToastConfig.instantiate()`
  - `ToastHelper` now reads all colors from `ToastConfig`, falling back to the original `CoreColors` defaults when not configured

### 🎯 [2.2.0] - Reactive State Management

- 🆕 **New Features**:
  - Added `ReactiveNotifier<T>` - A lightweight reactive value holder similar to `ValueNotifier` with extra convenience methods (`update`, `silent`, `refresh`)

  - Added `Reactive<T>` widget - A single unified widget for reactive UI rebuilds with optional features:
    - `buildWhen` - Control when to rebuild
    - `listener` - Side effects without rebuilding
    - `autoDispose` - Automatically dispose notifier when widget is removed
    - `Reactive.multi` - Listen to multiple notifiers
    - `Reactive.select` - Rebuild only when selected property changes
